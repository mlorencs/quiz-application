# React Snake Game

This is a very simple React project. There's probably many ways to optimize and improve this project, but I have created it by using my own logic. This project is a 2D Snake Game. This project is an improvement from my previous 2D Snake Game built on Angular. Issue with snake's movement that resulted in snake eating itself by chaning directions too quickly has been fixed. Snake's speed also has been implementated in to the game where speed currently caps at 80 (1.7 seconds).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

**Note: before running any scripts, make sure you have [Yarn]() installed on your machine and have installed dependencies:**

### `yarn` or `yarn install`

<br />

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console:

### `yarn start`

<br />

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn build`

<br />

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own. You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `yarn eject`

<br />
